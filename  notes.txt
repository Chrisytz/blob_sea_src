HELLO EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO THE TEXT FILE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING
HERE YOU WILL FIND STUPID IDEAS AND DESTROYED EGOS

Linking and things~
- all is working now (i think)
- how to compile glfw and assimp can be found here: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window
- the paths in CMakeLists.txt are mostly absolute paths
    - i just have a folder thats like OpenGL_Libraries and in it are all the libraries and includes and things
      (do not question the naming)
- for assimp you have to download the source zip file and compile it yourself bc the default one or wtv is messed up
- IDK WHY WE HAVE TO DRAG THE DLL FILE IN BUT IT WORKS SO IM NOT TOUCHING IT AND IM TOO SCARED TO DELETE IT BC
  IF IT BREAKS I WILL BE EXTREMELY SAD
- i spent an entire hour doing this and idt the model will even load in but thats a problem for another time...
  AT LEAST EVERYTHING IS LINKED FINE IDK WHY THIS WAS SO HARD THE FIRST TIME I TRIED T COMPILE ASSIMP IT GAVE ME SO
  MANY ERRORS SO I JUST TRIED AGAIN AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE??? LIKE WTF
- also yea now there are three :D submodules :D have fun :D hehe
